Introduction
Flight fare prediction is a common problem in the travel industry. Airlines and travel agencies often need accurate fare predictions to provide customers with competitive prices and make informed business decisions. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts flight fares based on factors such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airlines, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from source link. It includes historical flight data with features like departure and arrival locations, departure and arrival times, airline information, and the actual fares. This data will be used for training, validation, and testing of the machine learning model.
